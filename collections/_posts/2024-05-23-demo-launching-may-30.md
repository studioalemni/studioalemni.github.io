I’m happy to announce that the new demo for Legends of Astravia launches on Steam **next Thursday, May 30th**!

Cast spells, solve puzzles, and uncover secrets alongside a mystic companion in this 1-hour introduction to the magical world of Astravia :sparkles:

The demo will be available in both English and Japanese and be playable on Windows, macOS and SteamOS – we’ve confirmed it runs great on the Deck! 

It's wonderful that so many people are excited to play the demo, so this will be everyones' chance to catch an early glimpse a whole 10 days before the June 2024 Next Fest starts.

Thank you, as always for all of your support. I hope everyone is excited to see what Legends of Astravia has to offer!

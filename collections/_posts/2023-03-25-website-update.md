Studio Alemni has received a spiffy new website update! 

**Why the sudden change?**

Well, the original website was launched on Squarespace in early 2021--and after some consideration (and numerous difficulties with that platform)--I decided it was time for a custom implementation from the ground up. I wanted something that would be custom-tailored to my needs as a developer as well as easily scalable for future games.

There are a lot of aspects that I think will both improve my experience personally with writing developer's logs and adding / updating content, as well as improve visitors' experience with clearer navigation and responsiveness.

There may be a few additional changes over the next few days as I add the finishing touches, and unfortunately because I prematurely cancelled the Squarespace site (and they don't let you view page URLs when you do), some page links from other websites may be broken until I get it sorted out.

I hope you like the new look and feel. If you have any concerns, feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://www.discord.com/invite/astravia) or [send us an email]({{ '/contact' | relative_url }}).

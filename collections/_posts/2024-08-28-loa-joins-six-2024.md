Hey all, though briefly mentioned in last week's developer's log, I'm excited to officially announce it here:

Legends of Astravia will be at the Seattle Indies Expo 2024! :tada:

Please feel free to join us **this Sunday, September 1st 2024** if you're in the area (especially for PAX West, since it's [right down the road](https://goo.gl/maps/dnNpc4EPNYo)!)

The event is **100% free**! It runs from 12 PM-9PM Pacific, and there are 30+ other amazing games that will be showcasing as well. It is located at the Hilton Motif in the center of Seattle, WA. 

For more information, please check the SIX website: [https://six.seattleindies.org](https://six.seattleindies.org)

I'll be there the whole time, showing off the game, answering questions, and giving away some goodies:

This is the first time the game will be showcased in person, so I'm really looking forward to it. 

I hope to see some of you there!

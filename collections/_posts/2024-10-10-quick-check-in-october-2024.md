Hi everyone,

I figured it'd be best to be transparent at the risk of some professionalism. As hinted in my last few devlogs, this has been a pretty tough year for me. Despite the demo re-launch going well and the opportunity for some showcases, actual development progress on the project has stalled a bit since April as I've been trying to get my creative bearings alongside various personal issues that I've been struggling with. 

Updates on social media, etc. will continue to be sparse until I'm able to re-center. The overall focus on promotional material this year was, in a sense, "maintenance" to try and keep interest in the project alive, especially for those who have been following since 2021 (and even earlier). And while I feel it was necessary and lead to a lot of helpful feedback and research, ultimately it is becoming a bit counterintuitive as it is also robbing me of the time and energy that I need to focus on developing the project itself. 

**All this to say, instead of forcing more developer's logs and marketing, I will instead be holding off until I'm more comfortable and have made some progress I feel is worth reporting. This does not mean the project is on hiatus.**

I know this is a bummer for those of you who enjoy reading the developer's logs. And I'm sorry for the lack of updates and constant delays on the project overall. Unfortunately, needing to juggle a full-time job and personal life on top of working on this thing alone means these periods of burnout can only be rectified with time. 

I'm incredibly appreciative of the patience, support, and understanding as always.

# All Platforms

- “Pause” in battle doesn’t work when an animation is displaying
- In rare cases, some enemies may be targetable with items
- The camera can sometimes move jarringly and "snap" when moving between areas and in battle
- Enemies that die to burn will display a death animation twice
- The game needs to be relaunched to register an audio device change
- When using "Game Capture" in OBS, the game will appear vertically mirrored and needs to be flipped

# Windows Only

- Rebinding controls with the F1 menu will not update the icon prompts in messages and menus.
- Rebinding only works for keyboard and will not work for some controllers; it is advised to use the Steam controller interface to rebind controller buttons instead.
- Certain hardware configurations may result in a black screen. To fix it, disable the Steam Overlay.
- Some aggressive antivirus software, such as Avast, may declare the game executable as "suspicious" and require a scan before launching. This is a false positive, and likely due to the lack of official signing (an expensive process). The game's code is not a secret and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JaidenAlemni/mkxp-z).

# macOS Only

- Certain hardware configurations may result in performance issues on certain maps

# Linux / Steam Deck Only

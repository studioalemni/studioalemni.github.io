Legends of Astravia has undergone a lot of changes over the years. From the modest attempt in the 2017 IGMC contest to today, there have been several demos and the visuals, mechanics, and story have been continually refined.

Many old screenshots and promotional tweets were recently removed in order for the game to be more inline with its final release. However, I believe this media is a very important part of the game's history.

As such, I created a dedicated album that takes you through these posts over the years until today: [Album Link](https://imgur.com/a/j9dXxB0)

Unfortunately, until a better image hosting solution is available for the current website, I chose to use Imgur for now.

I hope you enjoy flipping through the game's transformations over the years, and if you're a game developer yourself, I hope that it gives you some insight and motivation to continue your own work. I took the time to add some retrospective notes that are hopefully helpful / funny.

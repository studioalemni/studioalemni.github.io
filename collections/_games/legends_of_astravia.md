# About
Legends of Astravia is a charming retro RPG set in a world of magic. You play as Oliver, a mystician on a quest to meet new companions and unravel his complicated past... and the truth behind a mysterious trio's plan to reawaken the Cataclysm and bring forth another age of ruin.

Influenced by 90s and early 2000s-era JRPGs like *Golden Sun* and *Grandia*, the game features hybrid time-based battles and an explorable world filled with twisting dungeons and countless secrets.

Vast, explorable overworld designed with care. Intricate dungeons filled with puzzles and traps are contrasted with lively towns and their welcoming NPCs and side-quests.

# Story
Oliver is a mystician—those in Astravia who are gifted with a natural talent to cast magic.  

After waking up lost and alone in the forested region of Mordin and being chased down by a band of corrupt knights, Oliver starts his journey training and recovering under the wing of the local swordsman (and farmer) Baldric. Learning to spar and helping tend to the farm, Oliver soon became accustomed to the villagers' simple lifestyle despite his hazy past. 

This calm did not last long, however, as a fated meeting with the enigmatic Azel and an encounter with a trio of “Astri Hunters” on the outskirts of town forced Oliver to realize that he is involved in something greater... and that he and Azel are somehow destined to cross paths. He sets off on a journey across the world to piece together his origins, meeting new companions—and enemies—along the way. 

However, for each step towards discovering the truth of his own past, Oliver gets further entangled in Astravia's dark and mysterious history... and he must unravel the truth before the reawakening of the Great Cataclysm brings forth another age of ruin.

# Two-Part Saga
Legend of Astravia’s epic, overarching saga will be delivered in two parts. This is the first half of that story, and the second half will release at a later date, either as a full game or as DLC depending on its final length. Each installment will be a full game with a complete story arc and hours of content.

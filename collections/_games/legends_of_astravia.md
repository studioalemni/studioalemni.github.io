# About
In this retro-style 2D RPG with modernized game mechanics, journey across Astravia as the wandering mystician Oliver and meet new companions, uncover secrets better left unknown, and stop a villainous trio’s plot to steal the powerful Astri and cause world destruction. 

Influenced by 90s and early 2000s-era JRPGs like *Golden Sun* and *Grandia*, the game features a dynamic battle system and a world rich with exploration and puzzles. 

![Dynamic Battles]({{ '/assets/loa/Description_Battle.png' | relative_url }})

A fresh spin on "Active Time Battle" (ATB), Legends of Astravia's turnless battle system encourages quick—but strategic—decision making. In this fluid system without “turns”, interact with enemy and ally actions in real time and feel the excitement of outracing your opponents with powerful magic and abilities. 

![Engaging Exploration]({{ '/assets/loa/Description_Explore.png' | relative_url }})

Vast, explorable overworld designed with care. Intricate dungeons filled with puzzles and traps are contrasted with lively towns and their welcoming NPCs and side-quests. And while the main story's obstacles are balanced and fair, there are plenty of optional areas with difficult and rewarding challenges to discover. 

![Charming Characters]({{ '/assets/loa/Description_Characters.png' | relative_url }})

A varied cast where each character's unique personality and traits shine through. In this character-driven story, scenes with dialogue are written to make you feel like you're in the company of your companions as they react to the changing world around them.

# Story
Oliver is a *mystician*—those in Astravia who are gifted with a natural talent to cast magic. Awakening deep in Mordin Forest with nothing but his shirt and circlet, Oliver finds himself at a loss as to how he ended up there. To make matters worse, the corrupt knights of the area seem all but welcoming towards mysticians. 

After a swift rescue by a kindly swordsman, he takes refuge along the outskirts of Mordin Village. There, questions about his past and a fated meeting with the enigmatic Azel leads Oliver on a quest across the world to recover his memory...all while the “Astri Hunters” plan to reawaken the Great Cataclysm for their own gain. 

Journey as a wandering mystician and meet new companions, uncover secrets better left unknown, and stop a villainous trio’s plot to steal the powerful Astri and cause world destruction...for the fate of Astravia!

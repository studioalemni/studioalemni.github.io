# Story
Oliver is a mystician—those in Astravia who are gifted with a natural talent to cast magic. After waking up in Mordin Forest with nothing but his shirt and circlet, he was assailed by a group of corrupt knights and rescued by a swordsman from the local village. As he recovered, he became quickly accustomed to the villagers' simple lifestyle regardless of his unclear past. 

This calm did not last long, however, as a fated meeting with the enigmatic Azel and an encounter with other, villainous mysticians forced Oliver to realize that he is involved in something greater...and that he and Azel are somehow destined to cross paths. He sets off towards Anatas to learn more about his origins, meeting new companions—and enemies—along the way. 

However, for each step towards discovering the truth of his own past, Oliver gets further entangled in Astravia's dark and mysterious history...

## _Legends of Astravia_ Related
#### What is the game about?

It is a retro-style 2D RPG with modernized game mechanics, where you journey across Astravia as the wandering mystician Oliver and meet new companions, uncover secrets better left unknown, and stop a villainous trio’s plot to steal the powerful Astri and cause world destruction. Influenced by 90s and early 2000s-era JRPGs like *Golden Sun* and *Grandia*, the game features a dynamic battle system and a world rich with exploration and puzzles.

You’ll find more information on the [detailed game page]({{ '/games/legends-of-astravia' | relative_url }}).

<!--
#### Where can I play it?

While the final game isn't done yet, there is a free, short demo available on [Steam]({{ loa.links.steam | relative_url }}). A standalone version is also available on [itch.io]({{ loa.links.itch | relative_url }}). 

Though, please keep in mind **this demo is now a little outdated**--it was released in February 2022. The final game will have [updated graphics]({{ '/2022/12/05/developers-log-nov-2022' | relative_url }}) and a lot of gameplay enhancements.
-->

#### Is it on Steam?

Yes! Check it out [here]({{ loa.links.steam | relative_url }}).

#### When will the game be done?

The projected release is TBD.

#### How much will it cost?

The game’s price is TBD.

#### Is the game episodic? 

The game will be released in exactly two parts, either as two separate games (think *Golden Sun* & *Golden Sun: The Lost Age*), or with the second half as DLC if it ends up being too short to justify an entire game release. This is because the world and scope of the story is far too large to fit in a single game, especially for a tiny indie developer! We promise that each installment will be a full game experience and will not feel incomplete or unfinished. 

#### Can I help beta test the game?

Closed betas are periodically run within the official [Discord server](https://www.discord.com/invite/astravia). You must have a Steam account. Please join the server and keep an eye out for details.

#### Can I stream or record it?

Of course! It is highly encouraged, unless you are a beta tester, in which case we only ask that you please do not stream or record beta versions. 

If you do stream the game, please let us know, we’d love to watch! 

#### Will the game be available on Nintendo Switch / Xbox / Playstation / Etc.?

Currently, the game is only due to release on Windows, macOS and Linux. Please note that the Linux version may not be available immediately, and may only be solely for supporting the Steam Deck. 

That said, if the game gets enough funding and support by the time the second half is completed, porting to consoles can happen, too.

#### Can I be a voice actor?

There will be no voice acting added to Legends of Astravia. 

If this changes for whatever reason after the game is released, an announcement will be posted on this website and on all our social media channels.

#### Can I help translate / localize the game to \[language\]?

The game already has arrangements for Japanese translation, and we are actively seeking someone to help with Japanese language support, via QA, social media and our communities. However, this is currently only a volunteer or revenue-share opportunity. If you are interested, please contact us [here](https://studioalemni.com/contact). 

Otherwise, as much as we’d love to have Legends of Astravia available in various other languages, we’re not hiring anyone at this time. We do not intend on using a generalized localization service—we are only interested in working with independent translators. 

Feel free to contact us if you are interested, but please understand that this isn’t a guarantee that your services will be used. Translation into other languages probably will not be considered until the game’s completion, even if offered for free, as the process to integrate is too arduous and takes away from the game’s development.

#### Is this game LGBT?

#### How can I help or support the game?

[Wishlisting on Steam]({{ loa.links.steam | relative_url }}) is a huge help, and costs nothing. You can also [donate directly to the game](https://ko-fi.com/astravia). The biggest aspect affecting development progress is funding at this point. 

Keeping an eye out for updates here or on Twitter and telling your friends about the game is also greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support! 

#### What script did you use for X? Can you teach me Y? 

Nearly every feature in Legends of Astravia has been custom coded and tailored to fit the game. Unfortunately I’m a little too busy to teach or provide advice. The internet is full of fantastic resources, which is what I used in my several year journey to make the game.

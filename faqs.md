## _Legends of Astravia_ Related
#### What is the game about?

It is a Japanese-style role-playing game (JRPG) that centers around several characters and their stories. It's inspired by classic games like *Golden Sun* and *Chrono Trigger*, and offers an explorable world with puzzles and dungeons alongside exciting battles and quests. 

You’ll find more information on the [detailed game page]({{ '/games/legends-of-astravia' | relative_url }}).

#### Where can I play it?

While the final game isn't done yet, there is a free, short demo available on [Steam]({{ loa.links.steam | relative_url }}). A standalone version is also available on [itch.io]({{ loa.links.itch | relative_url }}). 

Though, please keep in mind **this demo is now a little outdated**--it was released in February 2022. The final game will have [updated graphics]({{ '/2022/12/05/developers-log-nov-2022' | relative_url }}) and a lot of gameplay enhancements.

#### Is it on Steam?

Yes! Check it out [here]({{ loa.links.steam | relative_url }}).

#### When will the game be done?

The projected release is TBD.

#### How much will it cost?

The game’s price is TBD.

#### Can I help beta test the game?

Closed betas are periodically run within the official [Discord server](https://www.discord.com/invite/astravia). You must have a Steam account. Please join the server and keep an eye out for details.

#### Can I stream or record it?

Of course! If you are a beta tester then please do not stream or record beta versions.

If you do stream the game, please let us know! 

#### Will the game be available on Nintendo Switch / Xbox / Playstation / Etc.?

Currently, the game is only due to release on Windows, macOS and Linux. Please note that the Linux version may not be available immediately, and may only be solely for supporting the Steam Deck. 

That said, if the game gets enough funding by the time the final chapter is completed, porting to consoles can happen, too. 

#### Can I be a voice actor?

There will be no voice acting added to Legends of Astravia.

If this changes for whatever reason, there will be a casting call, which will be announced on Twitter and posted here. 

#### Can I help translate / localize the game to \[language\]?

We’d like to have Legends of Astravia available in various languages, but we're not hiring anyone at this time and do not intend on using a generalized localization service. We are interested in working with independent translators.

Feel free to contact us if you are interested, but please understand that this isn't a guarantee that your services will be used. Translation probably will not be considered until the final chapter releases.

#### Are you looking for a Publisher?

While we technically are not actively seeking out a publishing deal at this time, funding opportunities are always welcome. Feel free to [contact us]({{'/contact' | relative_url}}).

#### How can I help or support the game?

[Wishlisting on Steam]({{ loa.links.steam | relative_url }}) is a huge help, and costs nothing. You can also [donate directly](https://paypal.me/astravia) to the game. The biggest aspect affecting development progress is funding at this point.

Keeping an eye out for updates here or on Twitter and telling your friends about the game is also greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support!

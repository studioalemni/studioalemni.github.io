Feel free to send any questions, feedback, inquires, etc. through the form below, or by email via contact(at)thiswebsite.com. Please understand that we are small, and replies may take a few days. 

This form is strictly for business relevant to Studio Alemni and our games. Submissions attempting to personally contact any members of the team directly for any other reason will be disregarded.

**NOTE:** We are not looking to expand our development team at this time, and __most solicitations will be rejected__. Please [view the FAQs]({{ '/faqs' | relative_url }}) regarding common questions about localization, publishing, voice acting, etc. before sending us a request. Thank you!

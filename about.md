We are an independent game studio based out of Connecticut, USA.

The company is currently owned and run by one member: Jaiden. As a result, please pardon the occasional switch between "I" and "We" in news posts, articles, etc. 

Studio Alemni's current project, Legends of Astravia, takes inspiration from the classics like Golden Sun and Chrono Trigger, aiming to invoke the nostalgia of these role-playing games without bringing along the potentially dated and cumbersome mechanics. 

Jaiden started working on games formally in 2017, with the early conceptualization and demo of Legends of Astravia created for a contest. However, they've always had a passion for game design since they were a child, playing video games and wondering what it took to make such an engaging and involved interactive fantasy world. 

> I have always been fascinated with game design ever since I first had access to a game console and a computer. Some of the games that had the most impact on me were The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Final Fantasy VII and Dark Cloud.
>
> I first got my hands on RPG Maker XP in 2007. Some of my early designs for a video game at that time were really quite embarrassing, but the passion was there.
>
> After I graduated high school, I ended up dropping my pursuit for a game design career and instead opted to pursue Information Technology at a local community college.
>
> It was during this time that the regret set in, and I always found myself going back to designing games. Fast forward to the Indie Game Making Contest 2017, and I finally decided it was time to unearth my former passion.
>
> Legends of Astravia was born. While it was originally created for the IGMC 2017 contest, my ideas for the game kept growing and growing. It made for a terrible entry, but what was supposed to be a small game turned out to become the introduction to an epic RPG.
>
> Iâ€™ve since then spent the past several years honing my skills and solidifying my vision for the game. My goal with Legends of Astravia, and hopefully future games, is to bring to light that nostalgic feeling we all had when playing games like The Legend of Zelda, Chrono Trigger or Golden Sun. Something that makes you feel like you're part of the world and the characters within, with a story that keeps you compelled until the very end.

Of course, while Studio Alemni itself is technically single-member company, the development of Legends of Astravia has only been possible with the help of [various other freelancers and talented developers]() who have lent their time to the game.

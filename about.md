We are an independent game studio based out of Connecticut, USA.

The company is currently owned and run by one member: Jaiden. As a result, please pardon the occasional switch between "I" and "We" in news posts, articles, etc. 

Studio Alemni's current project, [Legends of Astravia]({{ '/games/legends-of-astravia' | relative_url }}), takes inspiration from the classics like *Golden Sun* and *Chrono Trigger*, aiming to invoke the nostalgia of these role-playing games without bringing along the potentially dated and cumbersome mechanics. 

Of course, while Studio Alemni itself is technically single-member company, the development of Legends of Astravia has only been possible with the help of [various other freelancers and talented developers]({{ '/loa-credits' | relative_url }}) who have lent their time to the game.
